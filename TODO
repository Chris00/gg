* General
** Review with M.() notation in mind. 
** M4, remove 3 in rot_map etc.
** grep TODO
** s/print/pp
** coordinate system and rectangles (?), origin top-left, but this
   implies that top < bottom, strange. bot-left is more math. See
   how it works with raster
** Do we introduce bigarray or leave that outside the module. 

* Float module 
** add clamp_angle 
   let clamp_angle a = 
     let a = mod_float a (6.28) in 
     if a > 3.14 then 6.28 +. a else
     if a < -3.14 then 6.28 +. a else
     a


* Color module
** of_hsv etc., especially sRGB -> lsRGB
** printers 
** ? replace gamma by tone curves.
** ? replace stops by tone curve
** ? replace stops by ramp
** ? mRGB specify in xyY or XYZ ? Have a look what png and tiff give.
** ? d50, xyY or XYZ     
** add delta functions
** add links to poynton faqs and porter duff paper.
** add d65
** ? add porter duff blending + semantics, or pdf blending ? 

* Raster module
** Verify usable with opencl/gl
** sample_format add reverse to specify BGR vs RGB, or not. 
** Extensible sample semantics, or not.
** add type image, which adds resolution and convention about first
   sample lower left frontmost pixel ? 
** Where do we put this, this is an image (vs raster) convention, but
   it would be nice to put it somewhere. The first sample in the
   buffer corresponds to the image's lower left and frontmost pixel.
** for cast mustn't sformat be abstract ?  
** shorter names ?

* Future
** Other bounding volumes Spheres, Oriented boxes
** Add further datatypes see tmp/ 
** Oboxes.

* ANN
  P.S. Take into account the following points. 

  * Gg is incomplete, it's a work in progress but what is here works
    and is expected to remain (note however that this release focuses
    on 2D aspects, parts of the 3d things was reworked from older
    code and was not thoroughly tested). 

  * Gg is not a linear algebra package. It's a module to give you
    basic mathematical tools and data structures for coding 2D & 3D
    graphics.
